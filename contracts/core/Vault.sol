 *
 * @dev The BakerFi vault deployed to any supported chain (Arbitrum One, Optimism, Ethereum,...)
 *
 * This is a smart contract where the users deposit their ETH or an ERC-20 and receive a share of the pool <x>brETH.
 * A share of the pool is an ERC-20 Token (transferable) and could be used to later withdraw their
 * owned amount of the pool that could contain (Assets + Yield). This vault could use a customized IStrategy
 * to deploy the capital and harvest a yield.
 *
 * The Contract is able to charge a performance and withdraw fee that is sent to the treasury
 * owned account when the fees are set by the deploy owner.
 *
 * The Vault is Pausable by a pauser role and is using the settings to retrieve base
 * performance, withdraw fees, and other kinds of settings.
 *
 * During the beta phase, only whitelisted addresses are able to deposit and withdraw.
 *
 * The Contract is upgradeable and can use a BakerProxy in front of it.
 *
 * The Vault follows the ERC-4626 Specification and can be integrated by any Aggregator.
 *
