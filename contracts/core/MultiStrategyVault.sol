 *
 * @dev The MultiStrategyVault is orchestration vault capable of managing multiple investment strategies.
 *
 * This is smart contract where the users deposit their ETH or an ERC-20 and receives a share of the pool <x>brETH.
 * A share of the pool is an ERC-20 Token (transferable) and could be used to later to withdraw their
 * owned amount of the pool that could contain (Assets + Yield).
 * This vault could use to support multiple strategies and deploy the capital on the strategies based on
 * set of weights defined by the vault manager.
 *
 * The Contract is able to charge a performance and withdraw fee that is send to the treasury
 * owned account when the fees are set by the deploy owner.
 *
 * The Vault is Pausable by a pauser role and is using the settings to retrieve base
 * performance, withdraw fees and other kind of settings.
 *
 * During the beta phase only whitelisted addresses are able to deposit and withdraw
 *
 * The Contract is upgradeable and can use a BakerProxy in front of.
 *
 * The Vault follows the ERC-4626 Specification and can be integrated by any Aggregator
 *
 * The rebalance function is allowing a flexible external management through the vault manager role
 * and could be used to perform a variety of operations such as harvesting yield, rebalancing assets,
 * changing weights, and other strategic actions that could be programmed by an external agent
 * that have access to external information and implement healthy procedures in order to protect the
 * vault or impreove the vault performance.
