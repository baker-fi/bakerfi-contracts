## StrategyAAVEv3Base

The Contract is abstract and needs to be extended to implement the
conversion between WETH and the collateral

_This contract implements a strategy and could be used to deploy ETH on a AAVE with  
the a recursive staking strategy and receive an amplified yield 

The Strategy interacts with :

✅ BalancerFlashLender to request a flash loan from Balancer
✅ Uniswap to convert from collateral token to WETH 
✅ Uniswap Quoter to reqques a precise price token 
✅ AAVE as the lending/borrow market 

The APY of this strategy depends on the followwin factors:

 ✅ Lido APY 
 ✅ AAVE v3 Borrow Rate 
 ✅ Target Loan to Value 
 ✅ Number of Loops on the recursive Strategy 

 Flow Deposit:
 1) Deploy X amount of ETH
 2) Borrow Y Amount of ETH
 3) Deposit X+Y amount of Collateral in AAVE 
 4) Borrow Y ETH From AAVE to pay the flash loan 
 5) Ends up with X+Y Amount of Collateral and Y of Debt
   
 LeverageRatio = LeverageFunc(numberOfLoops, LTV)
 APY ~=  LidoAPY - (LidoAPY-AAVE_Borrow_Rate)*(1-leverateRatio);

 This strategy could work for 
 rETH/WETH
 awstETH/WETH_

withdrawing the corresponding collateral, converting it to WETH, unwrapping WETH, and finally
sending the resulting ETH to the contract owner. The undeployment is subject to reentrancy protection.
The function returns the amount of ETH undeployed to the contract owner.

### harvest

```solidity
function harvest() external returns (int256 balanceChange)
```

_Harvests the strategy by rebalancing the collateral and debt positions.

This function allows the owner of the contract to harvest the strategy by rebalancing the collateral
and debt positions. It calculates the current collateral and debt positions, checks if the collateral
is higher than the debt, adjusts the debt if needed to maintain the loan-to-value (LTV) within the specified
range, and logs profit or loss based on changes in the deployed amount. The function returns the balance change
as an int256 value.

Requirements:
